# TODO List for SmartFarm Assistant Development

## Backend Setup
- [x] Create smartfarm-backend directory
- [x] Create package.json for backend with Express, Multer, CORS dependencies
- [x] Create server.js with Express setup, CORS, and route handlers
- [x] Create routes/analyzeCrop.js for mock disease detection API
- [x] Create routes/chat.js for mock chatbot API
- [x] Create routes/sensorData.js for simulated sensor data API
- [x] Install backend dependencies (npm install)
- [x] Run backend server on port 5000

## Frontend Updates
- [x] Update Dashboard.js to fetch real sensor data from backend
- [x] Update DiseaseDetection.js to use real /analyze-crop API
- [x] Update Chatbot.js to use real /chat API
- [x] Run frontend server on port 3000 (running on port 3001 due to conflict)

## Testing and Integration
- [x] Test disease detection: Upload image and check response (tested via API, multipart form data required for image upload; boundary error handled in frontend)
- [x] Test chatbot: Send message and check response (tested with keywords: 'disease' -> recommends upload; 'water' -> irrigation advice; others -> generic response)
- [x] Test dashboard: Verify sensor data fetching and chart updates (tested, returns simulated IoT data: temperature, humidity, soil moisture, pH, light, rainfall, next irrigation)
- [x] Ensure CORS and error handling work properly (CORS enabled, error handling in frontend; backend health check confirmed)
- [x] Full integration: Backend running on 5000, frontend on 3001; ready for demo
